    <h4>Sirius Black was the elder of two boys born to an aristocratic family that was fiercely proud of its pureblood status and vehemently anti-Muggle. Unlike his younger brother Regulus and just about all of his ancestors, Sirius was sorted into Gryffindor and rejected his familyâ€™s belief in pure-blood supremacy. People used to consider him as a murderer. It was later discovered that he's not.</h4>
